  This is a website That I have designed using Jekyll to present my portfolio and Assessment 2 for 
  WEB503. This is designed to track my progress as an embedded designer and assist me in the 
  future, allowing me to display my information better and provide better documentation on myself.

I am a 24 year old chef that has given up the trade for the promise of a better land in the much more
sustainable and world changing environment of IT studies. Therefore I have begun a Bachelor of IT at 
NMIT, while completing my apprenticeship for this trade under my Father and step-mother, under their 
business; FCTechologies LTD. 

Working as a chef, I began with fast paced, pre-theatre dining, in Melbourne before moving into 
seafood/brasserie dining, in Nelson, moving back to Melbourne to join a large team, running a bistro
style dining alongside a fine dining setup. I eventually went on to become the sous chef of this 
establishment and run the fine dining side, which recieved a rating of 1.5 hats under my supervision. 

Now, working for my parents, I have found that I am completing tasks I never thought possible, completely 
designing PCBs from scratch, Reflowing them, coding them and designing enclosures for them with a 3D printer.
